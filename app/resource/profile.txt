### PROFILE
Recent Computer Science graduate with a deep passion for AI and Machine Learning. Eager to apply my knowledge and skills in developing innovative, data-driven solutions to real-world problems. Ready to contribute to cutting-edge projects and grow within the field.

### EDUCATION
**University of Southampton, Malaysia Campus**  
October 2021 - June 2024  
Bachelor of Computer Science  
First Class Honour: Average grade of 77%

### WORK EXPERIENCE
**ViTrox Corporation Berhad | Intern**  
July 2023 - September 2023  
During my internship, I leveraged machine learning to classify failure patterns in camera systems. I transformed and analyzed raw data, applied clustering algorithms for classification, and labeled and augmented data groups. I then developed, trained, and fine-tuned a deep learning model to improve its performance, resulting in a more accurate and effective system.

### PROJECT1
**Skin Cancer Diagnosis using Deep Learning**  
Tools: Python, TensorFlow, Scikit-Learn, OpenCV, Flask  
- Develop a computer-aided diagnosis system using deep learning to distinguish between benign and malignant cancer cells.

- Implemented classification models using Random Forest, XGBoost, and Logistic Regression, optimizing them through hyperparameter tuning.
- Employed stratified k-fold cross-validation and used weighted F1 scores to evaluate model performance on imbalanced classes.
- Improved model performance through feature engineering, including encoding categorical variables and handling class imbalance.

### PROJECT3
**Recommender System**  
Tools: Python, TensorFlow, Numpy  
- Developed a recommendation system using matrix factorization with embeddings in TensorFlow/Keras.
- Implemented data loading and preprocessing routines to handle large-scale datasets (20M+ entries).

- Performed data mapping and conversion to ensure smooth integration with the machine learning pipeline.

### PROJECT4
**Sentiment Analysis with Na√Øve Bayes**  
Tools: Python, NLTK, Scikit-Learn  
- Implemented data preprocessing steps including tokenization, stop word removal, and text normalization to prepare the dataset for training.
- Built frequency dictionaries to capture word occurrence patterns in positive and negative tweets, enabling the calculation of log prior and log likelihood probabilities.
- Trained the Naive Bayes model to compute log prior and log likelihoods for words, improving the model's ability to predict sentiment based on input tweets.
- Utilized NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) for accessing Twitter datasets, processing text, and handling linguistic data.

### PROJECT5
**Netflix Clone**  
Tools: MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js, JSON Web Tokens (JWT), Bcrypt.js, RESTful API, Tailwind CSS, Zustand, Postman, Render  
- Developed a full-stack Netflix clone using the MERN stack, implementing user authentication (sign-up, login, logout) with secure token-based authentication (JWT) and password hashing (Bcrypt.js).
- Built and tested RESTful API endpoints to support user authentication, browsing, and searching functionalities, ensuring reliable client-server communication.
- Integrated the TMDB API for movies / TV shows details, as well as search functionality for dynamic content filtering.
- Utilized Tailwind CSS for designing a responsive and modern user interface, and managed global state effectively using Zustand for a smooth user experience.
- Conducted API testing using Postman to ensure reliability and correctness of backend services.
- Deployed the application on Render, providing reliable access to users.

### PROJECT6
**Product Store Web Application**  
Tools: MongoDB, Express, React, NodeJS, RESTful API, Zustand, Chakra, Postman  
- Developed a full-stack product store application utilizing the MERN stack, enabling dynamic interaction with a MongoDB database to manage product inventory including name, price, and images.
- Implemented RESTful API services to support basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, enhancing the application's functionality for real-time data management.
- Integrated Zustand for efficient global state management across the React application.
- Utilized Chakra UI to design a modern, responsive user interface.
- Conducted API testing with Postman, verifying the reliability and performance of server-side logic.

### PROJECT7
**Recipe App**  
Tools: ReactJS, Tailwind CSS, DaisyUI, API integration  
- Built a recipe app using ReactJS that fetches and displays recipes via API, showing images, names, and health-related information.
- Implemented search functionality to allow users to find recipes based on their preferences and add recipes to their favorites.
- Utilized local storage to retain favorited recipes across page reloads, enhancing user experience and data persistence.
